Distributions by the required beginning date.  You must receive at least a minimum amount for each year starting with the year before the year that contains your required beginning date. If an IRA owner dies after reaching age 73, but before their required beginning date, no minimum distribution is required for that year because death occurred before the required beginning date.    .Even if you begin receiving distributions before you reach age 73, you must begin calculating and receiving RMDs by your required beginning date..   More than minimum received.  If, in any year, you receive more than the required minimum distribution for that year, you won't receive credit for the additional amount when determining the required minimum distributions for future years.

However, any amount distributed in the year you become age 73 will be credited toward the amount that must be distributed by April 1 of the following year.   Distributions after the required beginning date.  The required minimum distribution for any year after the year you reach age 73 must be made by December 31 of that later year.    Distributions from individual retirement accounts.  If you are the owner of a traditional IRA that is an individual retirement account, you or your trustee must figure the required minimum distribution for each year. See Figuring the Owner's Required Minimum Distribution, later.    Distributions from individual retirement annuities.  If your traditional IRA is an individual retirement annuity, special rules apply to figuring the required minimum distribution. For more information on rules for annuities, see Regulations section 1.401(a)(9)-6. These regulations can be read in many libraries, and IRS offices, and online at IRS.gov.   Change in marital status.  For purposes of figuring your required minimum distribution, your marital status is determined as of January 1 of each year. If your spouse is a beneficiary of your IRA on January 1, they will remain a beneficiary for the entire year even if you get divorced or your spouse dies during the year. For purposes of determining your distribution period, a change in beneficiary is effective in the year following the year of death or divorce.   Change of beneficiary.  If your spouse is the sole beneficiary of your IRA, and they die before you, your spouse won't fail to be your sole beneficiary for the year they died solely because someone other than your spouse is named a beneficiary for the rest of that year. However, if you get divorced during the year and change the beneficiary designation on the IRA during that same year, your former spouse won't be treated as the sole beneficiary for that year.

Tables showing distribution periods and life expectancies are found in Appendix B and are discussed later.  IRA account balance.  The IRA account balance is the amount in the IRA at the end of the year preceding the year for which the required minimum distribution is being figured.    Contributions.  Contributions increase the account balance in the year they are made. If a contribution for last year isn't made until after December 31 of last year, it increases the account balance for this year, but not for last year. Disregard contributions made after December 31 of last year in determining your required minimum distribution for this year.   Outstanding rollovers.  The IRA account balance is adjusted by outstanding rollovers that aren't in any account at the end of the preceding year. For a rollover from a qualified plan or another IRA that wasn't in any account at the end of the preceding year, increase the account balance of the receiving IRA by the rollover amount valued as of the date of receipt.

Because you have no basis in your IRA, any distributions are fully taxable when received. See Reporting taxable distributions on your return, later. \n\n\nPartly taxable.\n  If you made nondeductible contributions or rolled over any after-tax amounts to any of your traditional IRAs, you have a cost basis (investment in the contract) equal to the amount of those contributions. These nondeductible contributions aren't taxed when they are distributed to you. They are a return of your investment in your IRA.\nOnly the part of the distribution that represents nondeductible contributions and rolled over after-tax amounts (your cost basis) is tax free. If nondeductible contributions have been made or after-tax amounts have been rolled over to your IRA, distributions consist partly of nondeductible contributions (basis) and partly of deductible contributions, earnings, and gains (if there are any). Until all of your basis has been distributed, each distribution is partly nontaxable and partly taxable. \n\n\nForm 8606.\n\nYou must complete Form 8606 and attach it to your return if you receive a distribution from a traditional IRA and have ever made nondeductible contributions or rolled over after-tax amounts to any of your traditional IRAs.

You need these amounts to complete lines 1, 2, 7, and 12 of Table 1. You can use the highest mortgage balances during the year, but you may benefit most by using the average balances. The following are methods you can use to figure your average mortgage balances. However, if a mortgage has more than one category of debt, see Mixed-use mortgages, later, in this section.\n\nAverage of first and last balance method.\nYou can use this method if all the following apply. \n\n\n\nYou didn't borrow any new amounts on the mortgage during the year. (This doesn't include borrowing the original mortgage amount.)"", 'Figure the balance of that category of debt for each month. This is the amount of the loan proceeds allocated to that category, reduced by your principal payments on the mortgage previously applied to that category. Principal payments on a mixed-use mortgage are applied in full to each category of debt, until its balance is zero, in the following order.\n\n\n\nFirst, any home equity debt not used to buy, build, or substantially improve the home.\n\n\nNext, any grandfathered debt.\n\n\nFinally, any home acquisition debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd together the monthly balances figured for b and c in (1).\n\n\n\n \n\n \nComplete line 12 of Table 1 using the figure from line 2 above. \n \n\nExample 1.\nIn 1986, you took out a first mortgage of $1,400,000. The mortgage was a 10-year balloon note and the entire balance on the note was due in 1996. You refinanced the debt in 1996 with a new 30-year mortgage (grandfathered debt). On March 2, 2024, when the home had a fair market value of $1,700,000 and you owed $500,000 on the mortgage, you took out a second mortgage for $200,000. You used $180,000 of the proceeds to make substantial improvements to your home (home acquisition debt) and the remaining $20,000 to buy a car (home equity debt). Under the loan agreement, you must make principal payments of $1,000 at the end of each month. During 2024, your principal payments on the second mortgage totaled $10,000.\nTo complete Table 1, line 7, you must figure a separate average balance for the part of your second mortgage that is home acquisition debt. The January and February balances were zero. The March through December balances were all $180,000 because none of your principal payments are applied to the home acquisition debt. (They are all applied to the home equity debt, reducing it to $10,000 [$20,000 − $10,000].) The monthly balances of the home acquisition debt total $1,800,000 ($180,000 × 10). Therefore, the average balance of the home acquisition debt for 2024 was $150,000 ($1,800,000 ÷ 12).\n\n \n\nExample 2.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1. In 2025, your January through October principal payments on your second mortgage are applied to the home equity debt, reducing it to zero. The balance of the home acquisition debt remains $180,000 for each of those months. Because your November and December principal payments are applied to the home acquisition debt, the November balance is $179,000 ($180,000 − $1,000) and the December balance is $178,000 ($180,000 − $2,000). The monthly balances total $2,157,000 [($180,000 × 10) + $179,000 + $178,000]. Therefore, the average balance of the home acquisition debt for 2025 is $179,750 ($2,157,000 ÷ 12).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLine 1\n\n\n\nFigure the average balance for the current year of each mortgage you had on all qualified homes on October 13, 1987 (grandfathered debt).

Add the average balances together and enter the total on line 12. See Average Mortgage Balance, earlier.\nNote.

See Refunds of interest, earlier. \n\n\n\n\nHow To Report\n\nGenerally, you can deduct the home mortgage interest and points reported to you on Form 1098 on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8a. However, any interest showing in box 1 of Form 1098 from a home equity loan, or a line of credit or credit card loan secured by the property, is not deductible if the proceeds were not used to buy, build, or substantially improve a qualified home. If you paid more deductible interest to the financial institution than the amount shown on Form 1098, show the portion of the deductible interest that was omitted from Form 1098 on line 8b. Attach a statement to your paper return explaining the difference and print “See attached” next to line 8b.\nDeduct home mortgage interest that wasn't reported to you on Form 1098 on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8b. If you paid home mortgage interest to the person from whom you bought your home, show that person's name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN) on the dotted lines next to line 8b. The seller must give you this number and you must give the seller your TIN. A Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, can be used for this purpose. Failure to meet any of these requirements may result in a $50 penalty for each failure. The TIN can be either a social security number, an individual taxpayer identification number (issued by the IRS), or an employer identification number (EIN).\nIf you can take a deduction for points that weren’t reported to you on Form 1098, deduct those points on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8c.\n\nMore than one borrower.\n\nIf you and at least one other person (other than your spouse if you file a joint return) were liable for and paid interest on a mortgage that was for your home, and the other person received a Form 1098 showing the interest that was paid during the year, attach a statement to your paper return explaining this. Show how much of the interest each of you paid, and give the name and address of the person who received the form. Deduct your share of the interest on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8b, and print “See attached” next to the line.\n \nSimilarly, if you're the payer of record on a mortgage on which there are other borrowers entitled to a deduction for the interest shown on the Form 1098 you received, deduct only your share of the interest on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 8a. Let each of the other borrowers know what their share is. \n\n\nMortgage proceeds used for business or investment.\n\nIf your home mortgage interest deduction is limited under the rules explained in Part II, but all or part of the mortgage proceeds were used for business, investment, or other deductible activities, see Table 2 near the end of this publication. It shows where to deduct the part of your excess interest that is for those activities. The Table 1 Instructions for line 16 in Part II explain how to divide the excess interest among the activities for which the mortgage proceeds were used. \n\n\n\n\nSpecial Rule for Tenant-Stockholders in Cooperative Housing Corporations\n\nA qualified home includes stock in a cooperative housing corporation owned by a tenant-stockholder. This applies only if the tenant-stockholder is entitled to live in the house or apartment because of owning stock in the cooperative.\n\nCooperative housing corporation.\nThis is a corporation that meets all of the following conditions. \n\n\n\nHas only one class of stock outstanding.\n\n\nHas no stockholders other than those that own the stock who can live in a house, apartment, or house trailer owned or leased by the corporation.\n\n\nHas no stockholders who can receive any distribution out of capital other than on a liquidation of the corporation.\n\n\nMeets at least one of the following requirements.\n\n\n\nReceives at least 80% of its gross income for the year in which the mortgage interest is paid or incurred from tenant-stockholders. For this purpose, gross income is all income received during the entire year, including amounts received before the corporation changed to cooperative ownership.\n\n\nAt all times during the year, at least 80% of the total square footage of the corporation's property is used or available for use by the tenant-stockholders for residential or residential-related use.\n\n\nAt least 90% of the corporation's expenditures paid or incurred during the year are for the acquisition, construction, management, maintenance, or care of corporate property for the benefit of the tenant-stockholders."", ""Mortgages you (or your spouse if married filing a joint return) took out after December 15, 2017, to buy, build, or substantially improve your home (called home acquisition debt), but only if throughout 2024 these mortgages plus any grandfathered debt totaled $750,000 or less ($375,000 or less if married filing separately).\n\n\n \nThe dollar limits for the second and third categories apply to the combined mortgages on your main home and second home. \n\n \nSee Part II for more detailed definitions of grandfathered debt and home acquisition debt.\n \nYou can use Figure A to check whether your home mortgage interest is fully deductible. \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.

Generally, an institution (such as a bank or governmental agency) that received interest payments of $600 or more during 2024 on one or more qualified student loans must send Form 1098-E (or an acceptable substitute) to each borrower by January 31, 2025.\n \nFor qualified student loans taken out before September 1, 2004, the institution is required to include on Form 1098-E only payments of stated interest. Other interest payments, such as certain loan origination fees and capitalized interest, may not appear on the form you receive. However, if you pay qualifying interest that isn't included on Form 1098-E, you can also deduct those amounts. See Allocating Payments Between Interest and Principal, earlier.\n \nThe lender may ask for a completed Form W-9S or similar statement to obtain the borrower's name, address, and taxpayer identification number. The form may also be used by the borrower to certify that the student loan was incurred solely to pay for qualified education expenses. \n\n\n\nEffect of the Amount of Your Income on the Amount of Your Deduction\n\nThe amount of your student loan interest deduction is phased out (gradually reduced) if your MAGI is between $80,000 and $95,000 ($165,000 and $195,000 if you file a joint return). You can't claim a student loan interest deduction if your MAGI is $95,000 or more ($195,000 or more if you file a joint return).\n\nModified adjusted gross income (MAGI).\n\nFor most taxpayers, MAGI is AGI as figured on their federal income tax return before subtracting any deduction for student loan interest.

After graduating from college, you worked as an intern for a nonprofit organization. As part of the internship program, the nonprofit organization made an interest payment on your behalf. This payment was treated as additional compensation and reported in box 1 of your Form W-2. Assuming all other qualifications are met, you can deduct this payment of interest on your tax return.\n\n \n\nExample 2.\nYou obtained a qualified student loan to attend college. After graduating from college, the first monthly payment on the loan was due in December. As a gift, your mother made this payment. No one is claiming you as a dependent on their tax return.

To figure the phaseout, multiply your interest deduction (before the phaseout, but not more than $2,500) by a fraction. The numerator (top part) is your MAGI minus $80,000 ($165,000 in the case of a joint return). The denominator (bottom part) is $15,000 ($30,000 in the case of a joint return).

However, participants may be able to transfer or roll over certain property from one retirement plan to another. See Pubs. 590-A and 590-B for more information about rollovers.\nYou don't have to make contributions every year. But if you make contributions, they must be based on a written allocation formula and must not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees (defined in chapter 1). When you contribute, you must contribute to the SEP IRAs of all participants who actually performed personal services during the year for which the contributions are made, including employees who die or terminate employment before the contributions are made.\nContributions are deductible within limits, as discussed later, and generally aren't taxable to the plan participants.\nEmployer contributions to a SEP IRA won’t affect the amount an individual can contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA.\nUnlike regular contributions to a traditional IRA before 2020, contributions under a SEP can be made to participants over age 70½. If you are self-employed, you can also make contributions under the SEP for yourself even if you are over age 70½. Participants age 73 or over must take RMDs.\n\nTime limit for making contributions.\nTo deduct contributions for a year, you must make the contributions by the due date (including extensions) of your tax return for the year.\n\n\n\nContribution Limits\n\nContributions you make for 2024 to a common-law employee's SEP IRA can't exceed the lesser of 25% of the employee's compensation or $69,000. Compensation generally doesn't include your contributions to the SEP. The SEP plan document will specify how the employer contribution is determined and how it will be allocated to participants.\n\nExample.\nYour employee has earned $21,000 for 2024. The maximum contribution you can make to your employee’s SEP IRA is $5,250 (25% (0.25) x $21,000).\n\n\nContributions for yourself.\n\nThe annual limits on your contributions to a common-law employee's SEP IRA also apply to contributions you make to your own SEP IRA. However, special rules apply when figuring your maximum deductible contribution. See Deduction Limit for Self-Employed Individuals, later.\n\n\nAnnual compensation limit.\nYou can't consider the part of an employee's compensation over $345,000 when figuring your contribution limit for that employee. However, $69,000 is the maximum contribution for an eligible employee. These limits increase to $350,000 and $70,000, respectively, in 2025.\n\nExample.\nYour employee has earned $260,000 for 2024. Because of the maximum contribution limit for 2024, you can only contribute $69,000 to your employee’s SEP IRA."", ""Simplified Employee Pension (SEP)\n\nA SEP is a written plan that allows your employer to make contributions to a traditional SEP IRA or Roth SEP IRA set up for you (the employee) by your employer to receive such contributions. Contributions to SEP IRAs are subject to different limits than traditional and Roth IRAs but distributions are subject to traditional and Roth IRA rules. See Pub. 560 for more information about SEPs.\n\n\n\nEmployer and Employee Association Trust Accounts\n\nYour employer or your labor union or other employee association can set up a trust to provide individual retirement accounts for employees or members, provided certain requirements are met (such as separate accounting). The requirements for individual retirement accounts apply to these traditional and Roth IRAs.\n\n\n\nRequired Disclosures\n\nThe trustee or issuer (sometimes called the sponsor) of your traditional IRA must generally give you a disclosure statement at least 7 days before you open your IRA. However, the sponsor doesn’t have to give you the statement until the date you open (or purchase, if earlier) your IRA, provided you are given at least 7 days from that date to revoke the IRA.\nThe disclosure statement must explain certain items in plain language. For example, the statement should explain when and how you can revoke the IRA, and include the name, address, and telephone number of the person to receive the notice of cancellation. This explanation must appear at the beginning of the disclosure statement. \nIf you revoke your IRA within the revocation period, the sponsor must return to you the entire amount you paid. The sponsor must report on the appropriate IRS forms both your contribution to the IRA (unless it was made by a trustee-to-trustee transfer) and the amount returned to you. These requirements apply to all sponsors.\n\n\n\n\nHow Much Can Be Contributed?\n\nThere are limits and other rules that affect the amount that can be contributed to a traditional IRA. These limits and rules are explained below.\n\nCommunity property laws.\n\nExcept as discussed later under Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA Limit, each spouse figures their limit separately, using their own compensation. This is the rule even in states with community property laws. \n\n\nBrokers' commissions.\n\nBrokers' commissions paid in connection with your traditional IRA are subject to the contribution limit. For information about whether you can deduct brokers' commissions, see Brokers' commissions, later, under How Much Can You Deduct. \n\n\nTrustees' fees.\n\nTrustees' administrative fees aren’t subject to the contribution limit. For information about whether you can deduct trustees' fees, see Trustees' fees, later, under How Much Can You Deduct. \n\n\nQualified reservist repayments.\n\nIf you were a member of a reserve component and you were ordered or called to active duty after September 11, 2001, you may be able to contribute (repay) to an IRA amounts equal to any qualified reservist distributions (defined under Early Distributions in Pub. 590-B) you received.

First, the distribution amount must be included in your gross income for the year, which means you will pay regular income tax on it. Additionally, there is an extra 10% tax on early distributions unless you qualify for certain exceptions. This additional tax is calculated on the amount of the distribution that is included in your gross income. However, if the distribution includes a return of nondeductible contributions, that portion is not subject to the additional tax. For specific types of retirement accounts, such as SIMPLE IRAs, the additional tax can be as high as 25% if the distribution occurs within the first two years of participation.

If an IRA owner dies after reaching age 73, but before their required beginning date, no minimum distribution is required for that year because death occurred before the required beginning date.    .Even if you begin receiving distributions before you reach age 73, you must begin calculating and receiving RMDs by your required beginning date..   More than minimum received.  If, in any year, you receive more than the required minimum distribution for that year, you won't receive credit for the additional amount when determining the required minimum distributions for future years. This means that if you receive more than your required minimum distribution in 1 year, you can't treat the excess (the amount that is more than the required minimum distribution) as part of your required minimum distribution for any later year. However, any amount distributed in the year you become age 73 will be credited toward the amount that must be distributed by April 1 of the following year.   Distributions after the required beginning date.  The required minimum distribution for any year after the year you reach age 73 must be made by December 31 of that later year.    Distributions from individual retirement accounts.  If you are the owner of a traditional IRA that is an individual retirement account, you or your trustee must figure the required minimum distribution for each year. See Figuring the Owner's Required Minimum Distribution, later.    Distributions from individual retirement annuities.  If your traditional IRA is an individual retirement annuity, special rules apply to figuring the required minimum distribution. For more information on rules for annuities, see Regulations section 1.401(a)(9)-6. These regulations can be read in many libraries, and IRS offices, and online at IRS.gov.   Change in marital status.  For purposes of figuring your required minimum distribution, your marital status is determined as of January 1 of each year. If your spouse is a beneficiary of your IRA on January 1, they will remain a beneficiary for the entire year even if you get divorced or your spouse dies during the year. For purposes of determining your distribution period, a change in beneficiary is effective in the year following the year of death or divorce.   Change of beneficiary.  If your spouse is the sole beneficiary of your IRA, and they die before you, your spouse won't fail to be your sole beneficiary for the year they died solely because someone other than your spouse is named a beneficiary for the rest of that year. However, if you get divorced during the year and change the beneficiary designation on the IRA during that same year, your former spouse won't be treated as the sole beneficiary for that year.     Figuring the Owner's Required Minimum Distribution Figure your required minimum distribution for each year by dividing the IRA account balance (defined next) as of the close of business on December 31 of the preceding year by the applicable distribution period or life expectancy. Tables showing distribution periods and life expectancies are found in Appendix B and are discussed later.  IRA account balance.  The IRA account balance is the amount in the IRA at the end of the year preceding the year for which the required minimum distribution is being figured.    Contributions.  Contributions increase the account balance in the year they are made. If a contribution for last year isn't made until after December 31 of last year, it increases the account balance for this year, but not for last year. Disregard contributions made after December 31 of last year in determining your required minimum distribution for this year.   Outstanding rollovers.  The IRA account balance is adjusted by outstanding rollovers that aren't in any account at the end of the preceding year. For a rollover from a qualified plan or another IRA that wasn't in any account at the end of the preceding year, increase the account balance of the receiving IRA by the rollover amount valued as of the date of receipt.   No recharacterizations of conversions made in 2018 or later."", ""You can make one or more contributions to an eligible retirement plan during the 3-year period beginning on the day after the date the distribution was received. You must be a beneficiary of the plan and the total amount you repay can’t exceed the amount of the distribution you receive regarding one of the early distributions in the list above.      Additional 10% Tax The additional tax on early distributions is 10% of the amount of the early distribution that you must include in your gross income. This tax is in addition to any regular income tax resulting from including the distribution in income.  The tax on early distributions doesn't apply to the part of a distribution that represents a return of your nondeductible contributions (basis).  Use Form 5329 to figure the tax. See the discussion of Form 5329, later, under Reporting Additional Taxes for information on filing the form.  Example. Tom Jones, who is 35 years old, receives a $3,000 distribution from his traditional IRA account. Tom doesn't meet any of the exceptions to the 10% additional tax, so the $3,000 is an early distribution. Tom never made any nondeductible contributions to his IRA. He must include the $3,000 in his gross income for the year of the distribution and pay income tax on it. Tom must also pay an additional tax of $300 (10% (0.10) × $3,000). He files Form 5329. See the filled-in Form 5329, later.    .Early distributions of funds from a SIMPLE retirement account made within 2 years of beginning participation in the SIMPLE are subject to a 25%, rather than a 10%, early distributions tax..

This phrase describes the following distributions:  Qualified birth or adoption distributions.  Terminal illness distributions.  Domestic abuse distributions.  Emergency personal expense distributions.  Qualified disaster recovery distributions.     Repaying the distribution.  When you make a repayment of certain early distributions affects how you report the distribution and repayment. Generally, if you make the distribution and a repayment in the same tax year, you can report the amount of the distribution, the amount of the repayment of the distribution, and if the amount of the repayment is less than the amount of the distribution, figure and report the taxable portion of the distribution on Form 1040, line 5b. However, if you make a repayment in a year following the year you make the distribution, you will need to amend the return for the tax year during which you made the distribution. You will lower your income for that year by reflecting the amount of the repayment. Amend your return by using Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.   Figuring the taxable amount.  When you make a repayment in a year other than the distribution year, you must figure the amount you must reduce your taxable income in the year of the distribution. If you are repaying less than the full distribution, you must figure the part of the distribution that was taxable when distributed. This will be the amount you lower your income on your amended return.    The tax-free/taxable ratio.  The tax-free/taxable ratio is that fraction arrived at by dividing the retirement plans basis by the value of the retirement plan at the end of the year. This ratio is used to determine what portion of the distribution you are repaying was taxable when distributed."", ""Plans that permitted withdrawal of employee contributions.\n\nIf you contributed before 1987 to a pension plan that, as of May 5, 1986, permitted you to withdraw your contributions before your separation from service, any distribution before your annuity starting date is tax free to the extent that it, when added to earlier distributions received after 1986, doesn't exceed your cost as of December 31, 1986. Apply the allocation described in the preceding discussion only to any excess distribution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution Before Annuity Starting Date From a Nonqualified Plan\n\n\n\n\nIf you receive a nonperiodic distribution before the annuity starting date from a plan other than a qualified retirement plan (nonqualified plan), it is allocated first to earnings (the taxable part) and then to the cost of the contract (the tax-free part). This allocation rule applies, for example, to a commercial annuity contract you bought directly from the issuer. You include in your gross income the smaller of:\n\n\n\nThe nonperiodic distribution, or\n\n\nThe amount by which the cash value of the contract (figured without considering any surrender charge) immediately before you receive the distribution exceeds your investment in the contract at that time.\n\n\n\n\n\nExample.\nYou bought an annuity from an insurance company. Before the annuity starting date under your annuity contract, you received a $7,000 distribution. At the time of the distribution, the annuity had a cash value of $16,000 and your investment in the contract was $10,000. The distribution is allocated first to earnings, so you must include $6,000 ($16,000 − $10,000) in your gross income. The remaining $1,000 ($7,000 − $6,000) is a tax-free return of part of your investment.\n\n\nException to allocation rule.\nCertain nonperiodic distributions received before the annuity starting date aren't subject to the allocation rule in the preceding discussion. Instead, you include the amount of the payment in gross income only to the extent that it exceeds the cost of the contract.\nThis exception applies to the following distributions. \n\n\n\nDistributions in full discharge of a contract that you receive as a refund of what you paid for the contract or for the complete surrender, redemption, or maturity of the contract. \n\n\nDistributions from life insurance or endowment contracts (other than modified endowment contracts, as defined in section 7702A of the Internal Revenue Code) that aren't received as an annuity under the contracts. \n\n\nDistributions under contracts entered into before August 14, 1982, to the extent that they are allocable to your investment before August 14, 1982. \n\n\n\n\nIf you bought an annuity contract before August 14, 1982, and made investments both before and after August 14, 1982, the distributed amounts are allocated to your investment or to earnings in the following order. \n\n\n\nThe part of your investment that was made before August 14, 1982. This part of the distribution is tax free.\n\n\nThe earnings on the part of your investment that was made before August 14, 1982. This part of the distribution is taxable.\n\n\nThe earnings on the part of your investment that was made after August 13, 1982. This part of the distribution is taxable.\n\n\nThe part of your investment that was made after August 13, 1982.

However, see Rollovers to Roth IRAs for an exception.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial Additional Taxes\nTo discourage the use of pension funds for purposes other than normal retirement, the law imposes additional taxes on early distributions of those funds and on failures to withdraw the funds timely. Ordinarily, you won't be subject to these taxes if you roll over all early distributions you receive, as explained earlier, and begin drawing out the funds at a normal retirement age in prorated amounts over your life expectancy. These special additional taxes are the taxes on:\n\n\n\nEarly distributions, and\n\n\nExcess accumulation (not receiving minimum distributions).\n\n\n\nThese taxes are discussed in the following sections.\n\n\nIf you must pay either of these taxes, report them on Form 5329.

This applies if you meet an exception to the tax on early distributions but box 7 of your Form 1099-R doesn't indicate an exception.\n\n\nTax on Early Distributions\n\nMost distributions (both periodic and nonperiodic) from qualified retirement plans and nonqualified annuity contracts made to you before you reach age 59½ are subject to an additional tax of 10%. This tax applies to the part of the distribution that you must include in gross income. It doesn't apply to any part of a distribution that is tax free, such as amounts that represent a return of your cost or that were rolled over to another retirement plan. It also doesn’t apply to corrective distributions of excess deferrals, excess contributions, or excess aggregate contributions (discussed earlier under Taxation of Nonperiodic Payments).\nFor this purpose, a qualified retirement plan is:\n\n\n\nA qualified employee plan (including a qualified cash or deferred arrangement (CODA) under Internal Revenue Code section 401(k)),\n\n\nA qualified employee annuity plan,\n\n\nA tax-sheltered annuity plan (403(b) plan), or\n\n\n\n\n\n.To the extent that a distribution is attributable to amounts an eligible state or local governmental section 457 deferred compensation plan has received in a direct transfer or rollover from a qualified retirement plan, described above, that distribution is considered a distribution from a qualified retirement plan..\n\n\n5% rate on certain early distributions from deferred annuity contracts.\n\nIf an early withdrawal from a deferred annuity is otherwise subject to the 10% additional tax, a 5% rate may apply instead. A 5% rate applies to distributions under a written election providing a specific schedule for the distribution of your interest in the contract if, as of March 1, 1986, you had begun receiving payments under the election. On line 4 of Form 5329, multiply the line 3 amount by 5% instead of 10%. Attach an explanation to your return. \n\n\nDistributions from designated Roth accounts allocable to in-plan Roth rollovers within the 5-year period.\nIf, within the 5-year period starting with the first day of your tax year in which you rolled over an amount from your 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b) plan to a designated Roth account, you take a distribution from the designated Roth account, you may have to pay the additional 10% tax on early distributions. You must generally pay the 10% additional tax on any amount attributable to the part of the in-plan Roth rollover that you had to include in income (recapture amount). A separate 5-year period applies to each in-plan Roth rollover. See Figuring your recapture amount, later, to determine the recapture amount, if any.\nThe 5-year period used for determining whether the 10% early distribution tax applies to a distribution allocable to an in-plan Roth rollover is separately determined for each in-plan Roth rollover, and isn't necessarily the same as the 5-year period used for determining whether a distribution is a qualified distribution.""]",A retirement plan distribution is considered 'early' and subject to a 10% additional tax if it is taken before the age of 59½.,A distribution from a qualified retirement plan is generally considered an early distribution if it is taken before you reach age 59 1/2.,1.0,0.925506282097012,0.8263888888751157,1.0,0.9880019112047111

It can be either an account or an annuity. Individual retirement accounts and annuities are described in chapter 1 under How Can a Traditional IRA Be Opened. Roth IRAs include Roth IRAs that receive employer contributions from SEP arrangements.\nTo be a Roth IRA, the account or annuity must be designated as a Roth IRA when it is opened.\nUnlike a traditional IRA, you can’t deduct contributions to a Roth IRA. But, if you satisfy the requirements, qualified distributions (discussed in chapter 2 of Pub. 590-B) are tax free, and if you choose, you can leave amounts in your Roth IRA as long as you live.\n\n.Beginning in 2023, SEP and SIMPLE IRAs can be designated as Roth IRAs..\n\n\nTraditional IRA.\nA traditional IRA is any IRA that isn’t a Roth IRA or SIMPLE IRA. Traditional IRAs are discussed in chapter 1. SIMPLE IRAs are discussed in Pub. 560.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Can a Roth IRA Be Opened?\n\nYou can open a Roth IRA at any time. However, the time for making contributions for any year is limited. See When Can You Make Contributions, later, under Can You Contribute to a Roth IRA.\n\n\n\nCan You Contribute to a Roth IRA?\n\nGenerally, you can contribute to a Roth IRA if you have taxable  compensation (defined later) and your  modified AGI (defined later) is less than:\n\n\n\n$240,000 for married filing jointly or qualifying surviving spouse;\n\n\n$161,000 for single, head of household, or married filing separately and you didn’t live with your spouse at any time during the year; and\n\n\n$10,000 for married filing separately and you lived with your spouse at any time during the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n.You may be able to claim a credit for contributions to your Roth IRA. For more information, see chapter 3..\n\n\nIs there an age limit for contributions?\n\nContributions can be made to your Roth IRA regardless of your age. \n\n\nCan you contribute to a Roth IRA for your spouse?\n\nYou can contribute to a Roth IRA for your spouse, provided the contributions satisfy the Kay Bailey Hutchison Spousal IRA limit discussed in chapter 1 under How Much Can Be Contributed, you file jointly, and your modified AGI is less than $240,000.\n\n\nCompensation.\nCompensation includes wages, salaries, tips, professional fees, bonuses, and other amounts received for providing personal services. It also includes commissions, self-employment income, nontaxable combat pay, military differential pay, taxable alimony and separate maintenance payments, and taxable non-tuition fellowship and stipend payments. For more information, see What Is Compensation under Who Can Open a Traditional IRA? in chapter 1.\n\n\nModified AGI.\n\nYour modified AGI for Roth IRA purposes is your AGI as shown on your return with some adjustments.

Rules for All Dependents\nThis part of the publication discusses the filing requirements for dependents, who is responsible for a child's return, how to figure a dependent's standard deduction, and whether a dependent can claim exemption from federal income tax withholding.\n\n\n\nFiling Requirements\n\nWhether a dependent has to file a return generally depends on the amount of the dependent's earned and unearned income and whether the dependent is married, is age 65 or older, or is blind.\n\n.A dependent may have to file a return even if his or her income is less than the amount that would normally require a return. See Other Filing Requirements, later..\n\nThe following sections apply to dependents with:\n\n\n\nEarned income only,\n\n\nUnearned income only, and\n\n\nBoth earned and unearned income.\n\n\n\n\nTo find out whether a dependent must file, read the section that applies, or use Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nEarned Income Only\n\nA dependent whose gross income is only earned income must file a return if the gross income is more than the amount listed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarital Status\nAmount\n\n\nSingle\n\xa0\n\n\nUnder 65 and not blind\n$12,550\n\n\nEither 65 or older or blind\n$14,250\n\n\n65 or older and blind\n$15,950\n\n\nMarried*\n\xa0\n\n\nUnder 65 and not blind\n$12,550\n\n\nEither 65 or older or blind\n$13,900\n\n\n65 or older and blind\n$15,250\n\n\n* If a dependent's spouse itemizes deductions on a separate return, the dependent must file a return if the dependent has $5 or more of gross income (earned and/or unearned).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample.\nWilliam is 16. His mother claims him as a dependent on her income tax return. He worked part time on weekends during the school year and full time during the summer. He earned $12,700 in wages. He didn't have any unearned income.\nHe must file a tax return because he has earned income only and his gross income is more than $12,550. If he is blind, he doesn't have to file a return because his gross income isn't more than $14,250.\n\n\n\n\nUnearned Income Only\n\nA dependent whose gross income is only unearned income must file a return if the gross income is more than the amount listed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarital Status\nAmount"", ""You can’t claim a person as a dependent unless that person is your qualifying child or qualifying relative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTests To Be a Qualifying Child\n\xa0\nTests To Be a Qualifying Relative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe child must be your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them.\n\n\nThe child must be (a) under age 19 at the end of the year and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly); (b) under age 24 at the end of the year, a student, and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly); or (c) any age if permanently and totally disabled.\n\n\nThe child must have lived with you for more than half of the year.2\n\n\nThe child must not have provided more than half of the child’s own support for the year.\n\n\nThe child must not be filing a joint return for the year (unless that joint return is filed only to get a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid).\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIf the child meets the rules to be a qualifying child of more than one person, generally only one person can actually treat the child as a qualifying child.

You can’t claim your child as a dependent."", ""Child of divorced or separated parents.\n\nFor purposes of the medical and dental expenses deduction, a child of divorced or separated parents can be treated as a dependent of both parents. Each parent can include the medical expenses they pay for the child if:\n\n\n\nThe child is in the custody of one or both parents for more than half the year;\n\n\nThe child receives over half of the child’s support during the year from the parents; and\n\n\nThe child's parents:\n\n\n\nAre divorced or legally separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance,\n\n\nAre separated under a written separation agreement, or\n\n\nLive apart at all times during the last 6 months of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This doesn't apply if the child's dependency is being claimed under a multiple support agreement (discussed later).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQualifying Relative\n\n\n\nA qualifying relative is a person:\n\n\n\nWho is your:\n\n\n\nSon, daughter, stepchild, or foster child, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild),\n\n\nBrother, sister, half brother, half sister, or a son or daughter of any of them,\n\n\nFather, mother, or an ancestor or sibling of either of them (for example, your grandmother, grandfather, aunt, or uncle),\n\n\nStepbrother, stepsister, stepfather, stepmother, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, or\n\n\nAny other person (other than your spouse) who lived with you all year as a member of your household if your relationship didn't violate local law,\n\n\n\n\n\nWho wasn't a qualifying child (see  Qualifying Child, earlier) of any taxpayer for 2024, and\n\n\nFor whom you provided over half of their support in 2024. But see Child of divorced or separated parents, earlier, Support claimed under a multiple support agreement next, and Kidnapped child under Qualifying Relative in Pub. 501.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport claimed under a multiple support agreement.\n\nIf you are considered to have provided more than half of a qualifying relative's support under a multiple support agreement, you can include medical expenses you pay for that person. A multiple support agreement is used when two or more people provide more than half of a person's support, but no one alone provides more than half.\n \nAny medical expenses paid by others who joined you in the agreement can't be included as medical expenses by anyone. However, you can include the entire unreimbursed amount you paid for medical expenses. \n \n\nExample.\nYou and your three siblings each provide one-fourth of your parent’s total support. Under a multiple support agreement, you treat your parent as your dependent. You paid all of your parent’s medical expenses. Your siblings repaid you for three-fourths of these expenses. In figuring your medical expense deduction, you can include only one-fourth of your parent’s medical expenses. Your siblings can't include any part of the expenses. However, if you and your siblings share the nonmedical support items and you separately pay all of your parent’s medical expenses, you can include the unreimbursed amount you paid for your parent’s medical expenses in your medical expenses. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecedent\n\nMedical expenses paid before death by the decedent are included in figuring any deduction for medical and dental expenses on the decedent's final income tax return. This includes expenses for the decedent's spouse and dependents as well as for the decedent.\nThe survivor or personal representative of a decedent can choose to treat certain expenses paid by the decedent's estate for the decedent's medical care as paid by the decedent at the time the medical services were provided. The expenses must be paid within the 1-year period beginning with the day after the date of death. If you are the survivor or personal representative making this choice, you must attach a statement to the decedent's Form 1040 or 1040-SR (or the decedent's amended return, Form 1040-X) saying that the expenses haven't been and won't be claimed on the estate tax return.\n\n.  Qualified medical expenses paid before death by the decedent aren't deductible if paid with a tax-free distribution from any Archer MSA, Medicare Advantage MSA, or health savings account. ."", ""You can’t claim a person as a dependent unless that person is your qualifying child or qualifying relative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTests To Be a Qualifying Child\n\xa0\nTests To Be a Qualifying Relative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe child must be your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them.\n\n\nThe child must be (a) under age 19 at the end of the year and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly); (b) under age 24 at the end of the year, a student, and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly); or (c) any age if permanently and totally disabled.\n\n\nThe child must have lived with you for more than half of the year.2\n\n\nThe child must not have provided more than half of the child’s own support for the year.\n\n\nThe child must not be filing a joint return for the year (unless that joint return is filed only to get a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid).\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIf the child meets the rules to be a qualifying child of more than one person, generally only one person can actually treat the child as a qualifying child.

Full-time work (or part-time work done at an employer's convenience) in a competitive work situation for at least the minimum wage shows that the child can engage in substantial gainful activity.\nSubstantial gainful activity isn't work done to take care of yourself or your home. It isn't unpaid work on hobbies, institutional therapy or training, school attendance, clubs, social programs, and similar activities. However, doing this kind of work may show that the child is able to engage in substantial gainful activity.\nThe fact that the child hasn’t worked for some time doesn't, by itself, prove the child can’t engage in substantial gainful activity.\nFor examples of substantial gainful activity, see the Instructions for Schedule R (Form 1040)."", ""You can’t claim a person as a dependent unless that person is your qualifying child or qualifying relative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTests To Be a Qualifying Child\n\xa0\nTests To Be a Qualifying Relative\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe child must be your son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, brother, sister, half brother, half sister, stepbrother, stepsister, or a descendant of any of them.\n\n\nThe child must be (a) under age 19 at the end of the year and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly); (b) under age 24 at the end of the year, a student, and younger than you (or your spouse if filing jointly); or (c) any age if permanently and totally disabled.\n\n\nThe child must have lived with you for more than half of the year.2\n\n\nThe child must not have provided more than half of the child’s own support for the year.\n\n\nThe child must not be filing a joint return for the year (unless that joint return is filed only to get a refund of income tax withheld or estimated tax paid).\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIf the child meets the rules to be a qualifying child of more than one person, generally only one person can actually treat the child as a qualifying child.

See Other Filing Requirements, later..\n\nThe following sections apply to dependents with:\n\n\n\nEarned income only,\n\n\nUnearned income only, and\n\n\nBoth earned and unearned income.\n\n\n\n\nTo find out whether a dependent must file, read the section that applies, or use Table 1.\n\n\n\n\nEarned Income Only\n\nA dependent whose gross income is only earned income must file a return if the gross income is more than the amount listed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarital Status\nAmount\n\n\nSingle\n\xa0\n\n\nUnder 65 and not blind\n$12,550\n\n\nEither 65 or older or blind\n$14,250\n\n\n65 or older and blind\n$15,950\n\n\nMarried*\n\xa0\n\n\nUnder 65 and not blind\n$12,550\n\n\nEither 65 or older or blind\n$13,900\n\n\n65 or older and blind\n$15,250\n\n\n* If a dependent's spouse itemizes deductions on a separate return, the dependent must file a return if the dependent has $5 or more of gross income (earned and/or unearned).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample.\nWilliam is 16. His mother claims him as a dependent on her income tax return. He worked part time on weekends during the school year and full time during the summer. He earned $12,700 in wages. He didn't have any unearned income.\nHe must file a tax return because he has earned income only and his gross income is more than $12,550. If he is blind, he doesn't have to file a return because his gross income isn't more than $14,250.\n\n\n\n\nUnearned Income Only\n\nA dependent whose gross income is only unearned income must file a return if the gross income is more than the amount listed in the following table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarital Status\nAmount""]","No, you cannot claim your 25-year-old child as a dependent.

LlamaIndex,Multi-Query,What is the purpose of Form W-4?,What is the purpose of Form W-4?,"['Sub question: What are the IRS guidelines regarding Form W-4?\nResponse: The IRS guidelines for Form W-4 include several key points. Employers are encouraged to use the official version of Form W-4, though they may use a substitute version if it contains identical language and meets all IRS rules. Employees cannot submit their own developed substitute forms. Any unauthorized changes or additions to Form W-4 make it invalid, and employers should not use invalid forms to calculate tax withholding. If an employee does not provide a valid Form W-4, employers should withhold taxes as if the employee is single or married filing separately, with no additional entries. Employers can establish electronic systems to receive Forms W-4 and should ensure that new forms are effective with the first wage payment. Additionally, employers should remind employees to update their Form W-4 if they owed taxes or received a large refund in the previous year.', ""Sub question: How does Form W-4 affect healthcare taxation?\nResponse: Form W-4 primarily affects federal income tax withholding from employees' wages and does not directly impact healthcare taxation.

While healthcare benefits may be part of an employee's compensation package, the Form W-4 itself does not specifically address healthcare taxation."", ""Substitute Forms W-4.\nYou’re encouraged to have your employees use the official version of Form W-4.

An employee who submits a false Form W-4 may be subject to a $500 penalty.

Tell the employee it is invalid and ask for another one. If the employee doesn't give you a valid one, and you have an earlier Form W-4 for this employee that is valid, withhold as you did before. If you don't have an earlier Form W-4 that is valid, withhold tax as if the employee had checked the box for Single or Married filing separately in Step 1(c) and made no entries in Step 2, Step 3, or Step 4 of the 2025 Form W-4.

Pub. 1494 has tables to figure the amount exempt from levy. If a levy issued in a prior year is still in effect and the taxpayer submits a new Statement of Exemptions and Filing Status, use the current year Pub. 1494 to figure the exempt amount. \n\n\n\n\nSocial Security and Medicare Taxes\n\nThe Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) provides for a federal system of old-age, survivors, disability, and hospital insurance. The old-age, survivors, and disability insurance part is financed by the social security tax. The hospital insurance part is financed by the Medicare tax. Each of these taxes is reported separately.\nGenerally, you’re required to withhold social security and Medicare taxes from your employees' wages and pay the employer share of these taxes. Certain types of wages and compensation aren't subject to social security and Medicare taxes. See section 5 and section 15 for details. Generally, employee wages are subject to social security and Medicare taxes regardless of the employee's age or whether they are receiving social security benefits.
