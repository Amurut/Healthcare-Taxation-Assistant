This distribution can’t be made from an ongoing SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA. For this purpose, a SEP IRA or SIMPLE IRA is ongoing if an employer contribution is made for the plan year ending with or within the tax year in which the distribution would be made.\n \nThe maximum qualified HSA funding distribution depends on the HDHP coverage (self-only or family) you have on the first day of the month in which the contribution is made and your age as of the end of the tax year. The distribution must be made directly by the trustee of the IRA to the trustee of the HSA. The distribution isn’t included in your income, isn’t deductible, and reduces the amount that can be contributed to your HSA. The qualified HSA funding distribution is shown on Form 8889 for the year in which the distribution is made.\n \nYou can generally make only one qualified HSA funding distribution during your lifetime. However, if you make a distribution during a month when you have self-only HDHP coverage, you can make another qualified HSA funding distribution in a later month in that tax year if you change to family HDHP coverage. The total qualified HSA funding distribution can’t be more than the contribution limit for family HDHP coverage plus any additional contribution to which you are entitled.', 'Example.\nIn 2024, you are an eligible individual, age 57, with self-only HDHP coverage. You can make a qualified HSA funding distribution of $5,150 ($4,150 plus $1,000 additional contribution).\n\n\nFunding distribution—testing period.\n\nYou must remain an eligible individual during the testing period. For a qualified HSA funding distribution, the testing period begins with the month in which the qualified HSA funding distribution is contributed and ends on the last day of the 12th month following that month. For example, if a qualified HSA funding distribution is contributed to your HSA on August 10, 2024, your testing period begins in August 2024, and ends on August 31, 2025.\n \nIf you fail to remain an eligible individual during the testing period, for reasons other than death or becoming disabled, you will have to include in income the qualified HSA funding distribution. You include this amount in income in the year in which you fail to be an eligible individual. This amount is also subject to a 10% additional tax. The income and the additional tax are calculated on Form 8889, Part III.\n \nEach qualified HSA funding distribution allowed has its own testing period. For example, you are an eligible individual, age 45, with self-only HDHP coverage. On June 18, 2024, you make a qualified HSA funding distribution. On July 27, 2024, you enroll in family HDHP coverage and on August 17, 2024, you make a qualified HSA funding distribution. Your testing period for the first distribution begins in June 2024 and ends on June 30, 2025. Your testing period for the second distribution begins in August 2024 and ends on August 31, 2025.\n \nThe testing period rule that applies under the last-month rule (discussed earlier) doesn’t apply to amounts contributed to an HSA through a qualified HSA funding distribution. If you remain an eligible individual during the entire funding distribution testing period, then no amount of that distribution is included in income and won’t be subject to the additional tax for failing to meet the last-month rule testing period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRollovers\n\n\n\n\nA rollover contribution isn’t included in your income, isn’t deductible, and doesn’t reduce your contribution limit.\n\nArcher MSAs and other HSAs.\nYou can roll over amounts from Archer MSAs and other HSAs into an HSA. You don’t have to be an eligible individual to make a rollover contribution from your existing HSA to a new HSA. Rollover contributions don’t need to be in cash. Rollovers aren’t subject to the annual contribution limits. \nYou must roll over the amount within 60 days after the date of receipt. You can make only one rollover contribution to an HSA during a 1-year period. \n\n\nNote.\nIf you instruct the trustee of your HSA to transfer funds directly to the trustee of another of your HSAs, the transfer isn’t considered a rollover. There is no limit on the number of these transfers. Don’t include the amount transferred in income, deduct it as a contribution, or include it as a distribution on Form 8889.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen To Contribute\n\n\n\n\nYou can make contributions to your HSA for 2024 through April 15, 2025. If you fail to be an eligible individual during 2024, you can still make contributions through April 15, 2025, for the months you were an eligible individual.\nYour employer can make contributions to your HSA from January 1, 2025, through April 15, 2025, that are allocated to 2024. Your employer must notify you and the trustee of your HSA that the contribution is for 2024.

If you were born before July 1, 1949, you were required to begin receiving required minimum distributions by April 1 of the year following the year you reach age 70 ½.   Distributions by the required beginning date.  You must receive at least a minimum amount for each year starting with the year before the year that contains your required beginning date. If an IRA owner dies after reaching age 73, but before their required beginning date, no minimum distribution is required for that year because death occurred before the required beginning date.    .Even if you begin receiving distributions before you reach age 73, you must begin calculating and receiving RMDs by your required beginning date..   More than minimum received.  If, in any year, you receive more than the required minimum distribution for that year, you won't receive credit for the additional amount when determining the required minimum distributions for future years. This means that if you receive more than your required minimum distribution in 1 year, you can't treat the excess (the amount that is more than the required minimum distribution) as part of your required minimum distribution for any later year. However, any amount distributed in the year you become age 73 will be credited toward the amount that must be distributed by April 1 of the following year.   Distributions after the required beginning date.  The required minimum distribution for any year after the year you reach age 73 must be made by December 31 of that later year.    Distributions from individual retirement accounts.  If you are the owner of a traditional IRA that is an individual retirement account, you or your trustee must figure the required minimum distribution for each year. See Figuring the Owner's Required Minimum Distribution, later.    Distributions from individual retirement annuities.  If your traditional IRA is an individual retirement annuity, special rules apply to figuring the required minimum distribution. For more information on rules for annuities, see Regulations section 1.401(a)(9)-6. These regulations can be read in many libraries, and IRS offices, and online at IRS.gov.   Change in marital status.  For purposes of figuring your required minimum distribution, your marital status is determined as of January 1 of each year. If your spouse is a beneficiary of your IRA on January 1, they will remain a beneficiary for the entire year even if you get divorced or your spouse dies during the year. For purposes of determining your distribution period, a change in beneficiary is effective in the year following the year of death or divorce.   Change of beneficiary.  If your spouse is the sole beneficiary of your IRA, and they die before you, your spouse won't fail to be your sole beneficiary for the year they died solely because someone other than your spouse is named a beneficiary for the rest of that year. However, if you get divorced during the year and change the beneficiary designation on the IRA during that same year, your former spouse won't be treated as the sole beneficiary for that year.     Figuring the Owner's Required Minimum Distribution Figure your required minimum distribution for each year by dividing the IRA account balance (defined next) as of the close of business on December 31 of the preceding year by the applicable distribution period or life expectancy. Tables showing distribution periods and life expectancies are found in Appendix B and are discussed later.  IRA account balance.  The IRA account balance is the amount in the IRA at the end of the year preceding the year for which the required minimum distribution is being figured.    Contributions.  Contributions increase the account balance in the year they are made. If a contribution for last year isn't made until after December 31 of last year, it increases the account balance for this year, but not for last year. Disregard contributions made after December 31 of last year in determining your required minimum distribution for this year.   Outstanding rollovers.  The IRA account balance is adjusted by outstanding rollovers that aren't in any account at the end of the preceding year. For a rollover from a qualified plan or another IRA that wasn't in any account at the end of the preceding year, increase the account balance of the receiving IRA by the rollover amount valued as of the date of receipt.

See Qualified charitable distributions under Are Distributions Taxable? in chapter 1 of Pub. 590-B for more information..\n\n\nOrdinary income.\n\nDistributions from traditional IRAs that you include in income are taxed as ordinary income.\n\n\nNo special treatment.\nIn figuring your tax, you can't use the 10-year tax option or capital gain treatment that applies to lump-sum distributions from qualified retirement plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributions Fully or Partly Taxable\n\n\n\nDistributions from your traditional IRA may be fully or partly taxable, depending on whether your IRA includes any nondeductible contributions.\n\nFully taxable.\nIf only deductible contributions were made to your traditional IRA (or IRAs, if you have more than one), you have no basis in your IRA. Because you have no basis in your IRA, any distributions are fully taxable when received. See Reporting taxable distributions on your return, later. \n\n\nPartly taxable.\n  If you made nondeductible contributions or rolled over any after-tax amounts to any of your traditional IRAs, you have a cost basis (investment in the contract) equal to the amount of those contributions. These nondeductible contributions aren't taxed when they are distributed to you. They are a return of your investment in your IRA.\nOnly the part of the distribution that represents nondeductible contributions and rolled over after-tax amounts (your cost basis) is tax free. If nondeductible contributions have been made or after-tax amounts have been rolled over to your IRA, distributions consist partly of nondeductible contributions (basis) and partly of deductible contributions, earnings, and gains (if there are any). Until all of your basis has been distributed, each distribution is partly nontaxable and partly taxable. \n\n\nForm 8606.\n\nYou must complete Form 8606 and attach it to your return if you receive a distribution from a traditional IRA and have ever made nondeductible contributions or rolled over after-tax amounts to any of your traditional IRAs. Using the form, you will figure the nontaxable distributions for 2024 and your total IRA basis for 2024 and earlier years.\n\n\nNote.\nIf you are required to file Form 8606 but you aren't required to file an income tax return, you must still file Form 8606.

However, if your MAGI is less than $95,000 ($195,000 if filing a joint return), you may be allowed a special deduction for paying interest on a student loan (also known as an education loan) used for higher education. For most taxpayers, MAGI is the adjusted gross income (AGI) as figured on their federal income tax return before subtracting any deduction for student loan interest. This deduction can reduce the amount of your income subject to tax by up to $2,500.\nThe student loan interest deduction is claimed as an adjustment to income.

The university did not require payment of any fees in addition to the tuition in order to enroll in or attend classes. To help pay these costs, Joan was awarded a $2,000 scholarship and a $4,000 student loan. The terms of the scholarship state that it can be used to pay any of Joan's college expenses.\nUniversity X applies the $2,000 scholarship against Joan's $8,000 total bill, and Joan pays the $6,000 balance of the bill from University X with a combination of the student loan and personal savings. Joan doesn't report any portion of the scholarship as income on the tax return.\nIn figuring the amount of either education credit (American opportunity or lifetime learning), Joan must reduce the qualified education expenses by the amount of the scholarship ($2,000) because the entire scholarship was excluded from the reported income on Joan’s tax return. The student loan isn't tax-free educational assistance, so the qualified expenses don't need to be reduced by any part of the loan proceeds. Joan is treated as having paid $1,000 in qualified education expenses ($3,000 tuition − $2,000 scholarship).\n\n\nExample 2.\nThe facts are the same as in Example 1, except that Joan reports the entire scholarship as income on the tax return. Because Joan reported the entire $2,000 scholarship as income, the qualified education expenses don't need to be reduced. Joan is treated as having paid $3,000 in qualified education expenses. \n\n\nCoordination with Pell grants and other scholarships.\nYou may be able to increase your American opportunity credit when the student (you, your spouse, or your dependent) includes certain scholarships or fellowship grants in the student's gross income. Your credit may increase only if the amount of the student's qualified education expenses minus the total amount of scholarships and fellowship grants is less than $4,000. If this situation applies, consider including some or all of the scholarship or fellowship grant in the student's income in order to treat the included amount as paying nonqualified expenses instead of qualified education expenses. Nonqualified expenses are expenses such as room and board that aren't qualified education expenses such as tuition and related fees. \nScholarships and fellowship grants that the student includes in income don't reduce the student's qualified education expenses available to figure your American opportunity credit. Thus, including enough scholarship or fellowship grant in the student's income to report up to $4,000 in qualified education expenses for your American opportunity credit may increase the credit by enough to increase your tax refund or reduce the amount of tax you owe even considering any increased tax liability from the additional income. However, the increase in tax liability as well as the loss of other tax credits may be greater than the additional American opportunity credit and may cause your tax refund to decrease or the amount of tax you owe to increase. Your specific circumstances will determine what amount, if any, of scholarship or fellowship grant to include in income to maximize your tax refund or minimize the amount of tax you owe."", "".You can't deduct the interest you paid on a student loan to the extent payments were made through your participation in the above programs..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.

An IRS model SEP isn't considered adopted until you give each employee this information.\n\n\nSetting up the employee's SEP IRA.\nA SEP IRA must be set up by or for each eligible employee (the SEP IRA may either be a traditional SEP IRA or a Roth SEP IRA). SEP IRAs can be set up with banks, insurance companies, or other qualified financial institutions. You send SEP contributions to the financial institution where the SEP IRA is maintained.\n\n\nDeadline for setting up a SEP.\nYou can set up a SEP for any year as late as the due date (including extensions) of your income tax return for that year.\n\n\n\n\nHow Much Can I Contribute?\n\nThe SEP rules permit you to contribute a limited amount of money each year to each employee's SEP IRA. If you are self-employed, you can contribute to your own SEP IRA. Contributions must be in the form of money (cash, check, or money order). You can't contribute property. However, participants may be able to transfer or roll over certain property from one retirement plan to another. See Pubs. 590-A and 590-B for more information about rollovers.\nYou don't have to make contributions every year. But if you make contributions, they must be based on a written allocation formula and must not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees (defined in chapter 1). When you contribute, you must contribute to the SEP IRAs of all participants who actually performed personal services during the year for which the contributions are made, including employees who die or terminate employment before the contributions are made.\nContributions are deductible within limits, as discussed later, and generally aren't taxable to the plan participants.\nEmployer contributions to a SEP IRA won’t affect the amount an individual can contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA.\nUnlike regular contributions to a traditional IRA before 2020, contributions under a SEP can be made to participants over age 70½. If you are self-employed, you can also make contributions under the SEP for yourself even if you are over age 70½. Participants age 73 or over must take RMDs.\n\nTime limit for making contributions.\nTo deduct contributions for a year, you must make the contributions by the due date (including extensions) of your tax return for the year.\n\n\n\nContribution Limits\n\nContributions you make for 2024 to a common-law employee's SEP IRA can't exceed the lesser of 25% of the employee's compensation or $69,000. Compensation generally doesn't include your contributions to the SEP. The SEP plan document will specify how the employer contribution is determined and how it will be allocated to participants.\n\nExample.\nYour employee has earned $21,000 for 2024. The maximum contribution you can make to your employee’s SEP IRA is $5,250 (25% (0.25) x $21,000).\n\n\nContributions for yourself.\n\nThe annual limits on your contributions to a common-law employee's SEP IRA also apply to contributions you make to your own SEP IRA. However, special rules apply when figuring your maximum deductible contribution. See Deduction Limit for Self-Employed Individuals, later.\n\n\nAnnual compensation limit.\nYou can't consider the part of an employee's compensation over $345,000 when figuring your contribution limit for that employee. However, $69,000 is the maximum contribution for an eligible employee. These limits increase to $350,000 and $70,000, respectively, in 2025.\n\nExample.\nYour employee has earned $260,000 for 2024. Because of the maximum contribution limit for 2024, you can only contribute $69,000 to your employee’s SEP IRA.""]"

All or part of a qualified reservist distribution can be repaid to an IRA. The additional 10% tax on early distributions doesn't apply to a qualified reservist distribution.\n\n\n\n\nTax Treatment of Distributions\n\nDistributions from a qualified plan minus a prorated part of any cost basis are subject to income tax in the year they are distributed. Because most recipients have no cost basis, a distribution is generally fully taxable. An exception is a distribution that is properly rolled over as discussed under Rollover next.\nThe tax treatment of distributions depends on whether they are made periodically over several years or life (periodic distributions) or are nonperiodic distributions. See Taxation of Periodic Payments  and Taxation of Nonperiodic Payments in Pub. 575 for a detailed description of how distributions are taxed, including the 10-year tax option or capital gain treatment of a lump-sum distribution.\n\nNote.\nA recipient of a distribution from a designated Roth account will have a cost basis because designated Roth contributions are made on an after-tax basis. Also, a distribution from a designated Roth account is entirely tax free if certain conditions are met. See Qualified distributions under Qualified Roth Contribution Program, earlier.\n\n\nRollover.\n\nThe recipient of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan can defer the tax on it by rolling it over into a traditional IRA or another eligible retirement plan. However, it may be subject to withholding, as discussed under Withholding requirement, later. A rollover can also be made to a Roth IRA, in which case any previously untaxed amounts are includible in gross income unless the rollover is from a designated Roth account.\n\n\nEligible rollover distribution.\nThis is a distribution of all or any part of an employee's balance in a qualified retirement plan that isn't any of the following. \n\n\n\nAn RMD. See Required Distributions, earlier.\n\n\nAny of a series of substantially equal payments made at least once a year over any of the following periods.\n\n\n\nThe employee's life or life expectancy.\n\n\nThe joint lives or life expectancies of the employee and beneficiary.\n\n\nA period of 10 years or longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nA hardship distribution.\n\n\nLoans treated as distributions.\n\n\nDividends on employer securities.\n\n\nThe cost of any life insurance coverage provided under a qualified retirement plan.\n\n\nSimilar items designated by the IRS in published guidance. See, for example, the Instructions for Forms 1099-R and 5498.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRollover of nontaxable amounts.\nYou may be able to roll over the nontaxable part of a distribution to another qualified retirement plan or a section 403(b) plan, or to an IRA. If the rollover is to a qualified retirement plan or a section 403(b) plan that separately accounts for the taxable and nontaxable parts of the rollover, the transfer must be made through a direct (trustee-to-trustee) rollover. If the rollover is to an IRA, the transfer can be made by any rollover method.\n\nNote.\nA distribution from a designated Roth account can be rolled over to another designated Roth account or to a Roth IRA. If the rollover is to a Roth IRA, it can be rolled over by any rollover method, but if the rollover is to another designated Roth account, it must be rolled over directly (trustee-to-trustee).\n\n\n\nMore information.\nFor more information about rollovers, see Rollovers in Pubs. 575 and 590-A.

For guidance on rolling money into a qualified plan, see Revenue Ruling 2014-9, 2014-17 I.R.B. 975, available at IRS.gov/irb/2014-17_IRB/ar05.html."", ""You can make one or more contributions to an eligible retirement plan during the 3-year period beginning on the day after the date the distribution was received. You must be a beneficiary of the plan and the total amount you repay can’t exceed the amount of the distribution you receive regarding one of the early distributions in the list above.      Additional 10% Tax The additional tax on early distributions is 10% of the amount of the early distribution that you must include in your gross income. This tax is in addition to any regular income tax resulting from including the distribution in income.  The tax on early distributions doesn't apply to the part of a distribution that represents a return of your nondeductible contributions (basis).  Use Form 5329 to figure the tax. See the discussion of Form 5329, later, under Reporting Additional Taxes for information on filing the form.  Example. Tom Jones, who is 35 years old, receives a $3,000 distribution from his traditional IRA account. Tom doesn't meet any of the exceptions to the 10% additional tax, so the $3,000 is an early distribution. Tom never made any nondeductible contributions to his IRA. He must include the $3,000 in his gross income for the year of the distribution and pay income tax on it. Tom must also pay an additional tax of $300 (10% (0.10) × $3,000). He files Form 5329. See the filled-in Form 5329, later.    .Early distributions of funds from a SIMPLE retirement account made within 2 years of beginning participation in the SIMPLE are subject to a 25%, rather than a 10%, early distributions tax..

This phrase describes the following distributions:  Qualified birth or adoption distributions.  Terminal illness distributions.  Domestic abuse distributions.  Emergency personal expense distributions.  Qualified disaster recovery distributions.     Repaying the distribution.  When you make a repayment of certain early distributions affects how you report the distribution and repayment. Generally, if you make the distribution and a repayment in the same tax year, you can report the amount of the distribution, the amount of the repayment of the distribution, and if the amount of the repayment is less than the amount of the distribution, figure and report the taxable portion of the distribution on Form 1040, line 5b. However, if you make a repayment in a year following the year you make the distribution, you will need to amend the return for the tax year during which you made the distribution. You will lower your income for that year by reflecting the amount of the repayment. Amend your return by using Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.   Figuring the taxable amount.  When you make a repayment in a year other than the distribution year, you must figure the amount you must reduce your taxable income in the year of the distribution. If you are repaying less than the full distribution, you must figure the part of the distribution that was taxable when distributed. This will be the amount you lower your income on your amended return.    The tax-free/taxable ratio.  The tax-free/taxable ratio is that fraction arrived at by dividing the retirement plans basis by the value of the retirement plan at the end of the year. This ratio is used to determine what portion of the distribution you are repaying was taxable when distributed.""]"

This form helps the employer determine the correct amount of federal income tax to withhold from the employee's wages. Employees are encouraged to update their Form W-4 if their financial situation changes, such as owing taxes or receiving a large refund in the previous tax year.","[""More information.\nFor more information about the redesigned Form W‐4 and regulations that provide guidance for employers concerning income tax withholding from employees’ wages, see Treasury Decision 9924, 2020‐44 I.R.B. 943, available at IRS.gov/irb/2020‐44_IRB#TD‐9924.

Encourage your employees to file an updated Form W-4 for 2025, especially if they owed taxes or received a large refund when filing their 2024 tax return.\n \nAsk all new employees to give you a signed Form W-4 when they start work. Make the form effective with the first wage payment. If a new employee doesn't give you a completed Form W-4 in 2025 (including an employee who previously worked for you and was rehired in 2025, and who fails to furnish a Form W-4), treat the new employee as if they had checked the box for Single or Married filing separately in Step 1(c) and made no entries in Step 2, Step 3, or Step 4 of the 2025 Form W-4. An employee who was paid wages before 2020 and who failed to furnish a Form W-4 should continue to be treated as single and claiming zero allowances on a 2019 Form W-4. If you use the optional computational bridge, described earlier under Redesigned Form W-4, you may treat this employee as if they had checked the box for Single or Married filing separately in Step 1(c), and made no entries in Step 2 and Step 3, an entry of $8,600 in Step 4(a), and an entry of zero in Step 4(b) of the 2025 Form W-4.\n\n\nElectronic system to receive Form W-4.\nYou may establish a system to electronically receive Forms W-4 from your employees.

When you receive a new Form W-4 from an employee, don't adjust withholding for pay periods before the effective date of the new form. If an employee gives you a Form W-4 that replaces an existing Form W-4, begin withholding no later than the start of the first payroll period ending on or after the 30th day from the date when you received the replacement Form W-4.

You may use a substitute version of Form W-4 to meet your business needs. However, your substitute Form W-4 must contain language that is identical to the official Form W-4 and your form must meet all current IRS rules for substitute forms. At the time you provide your substitute form to the employee, you must provide them with all tables, instructions, and worksheets from the current Form W-4. For more information, see Pub. 15-T.\nYou can't accept substitute Forms W-4 developed by employees. An employee who submits an employee-developed substitute Form W-4 after October 10, 2007, will be treated as failing to furnish a Form W-4. However, continue to honor any valid employee-developed Forms W-4 you accepted before October 11, 2007.\n\n\nInvalid Forms W-4.\nAny unauthorized change or addition to Form W-4 makes it invalid. This includes taking out any language by which the employee certifies the form is correct. A Form W-4 is also invalid if, by the date an employee gives it to you, they clearly indicate it is false. An employee who submits a false Form W-4 may be subject to a $500 penalty. You may treat a Form W-4 as invalid if the employee wrote “exempt” below Step 4(c) and checked the box in Step 2(c) or entered numbers for Steps 3 and 4. \nWhen you get an invalid Form W-4, don't use it to figure federal income tax withholding. Tell the employee it is invalid and ask for another one. If the employee doesn't give you a valid one, and you have an earlier Form W-4 for this employee that is valid, withhold as you did before. If you don't have an earlier Form W-4 that is valid, withhold tax as if the employee had checked the box for Single or Married filing separately in Step 1(c) and made no entries in Step 2, Step 3, or Step 4 of the 2025 Form W-4. However, an employee who was paid wages in 2019 who never submitted a valid Form W-4 and submits an invalid Form W-4 in 2025 should continue to be treated as single and claiming zero allowances on a 2019 Form W-4. If you use the optional computational bridge, described earlier under Redesigned Form W-4, you may treat this employee as if they had checked the box for Single or Married filing separately in Step 1(c), and made no entries in Step 2 and Step 3, an entry of $8,600 in Step 4(a), and an entry of zero in Step 4(b) of the 2025 Form W-4.\n\n\nAmounts exempt from levy on wages, salary, and other income.\n\nIf you receive a Notice of Levy on Wages, Salary, and Other Income (a notice in the Form 668 series), you must withhold amounts as described in the instructions for these forms. Pub. 1494 has tables to figure the amount exempt from levy. If a levy issued in a prior year is still in effect and the taxpayer submits a new Statement of Exemptions and Filing Status, use the current year Pub. 1494 to figure the exempt amount. \n\n\n\n\nSocial Security and Medicare Taxes\n\nThe Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) provides for a federal system of old-age, survivors, disability, and hospital insurance. The old-age, survivors, and disability insurance part is financed by the social security tax. The hospital insurance part is financed by the Medicare tax. Each of these taxes is reported separately.\nGenerally, you’re required to withhold social security and Medicare taxes from your employees' wages and pay the employer share of these taxes. Certain types of wages and compensation aren't subject to social security and Medicare taxes. See section 5 and section 15 for details. Generally, employee wages are subject to social security and Medicare taxes regardless of the employee's age or whether they are receiving social security benefits. If the employee reported tips, see section 6.\n\nThe $150 test or the $2,500 test for farmwork.\nAll cash wages that you pay to an employee during the year for farmwork are subject to social security and Medicare taxes and federal income tax withholding if either of the two tests below is met.\n\n\n\nYou pay cash wages to an employee of $150 or more in a year for farmwork (count all cash wages paid on a time, piecework, or other basis). The $150 test applies separately to each farmworker that you employ. If you employ a family of workers, each member is treated separately. Don't count wages paid by other employers.""]"

Additional Rules for Listed Property\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis chapter discusses the deduction limits and other special rules that apply to certain listed property. Listed property includes cars, business aircraft, and other property used for transportation, property used for entertainment, and certain computers.\nDeductions for listed property (other than certain leased property) are subject to the following special rules and limits.\n\n\n\nDeduction for employees. If your use of the property is not for your employer's convenience or is not required as a condition of your employment, you cannot deduct depreciation or rent expenses for your use of the property as an employee.\n\n\nBusiness-use requirement. If the property is not used predominantly (more than 50%) for qualified business use, you cannot claim the section 179 deduction or a special depreciation allowance. For business aircraft, there is also a 25% test that must be met. In addition, you must figure any depreciation deduction under MACRS using the straight line method over the ADS recovery period. You may also have to recapture (include in income) any excess depreciation claimed in previous years. A similar inclusion amount applies to certain leased property.\n\n\nPassenger automobile limits and rules. Annual limits apply to depreciation deductions (including section 179 deductions and any special depreciation allowance) for certain passenger automobiles. You can continue to deduct depreciation for the unrecovered basis resulting from these limits after the end of the recovery period.\n\n\n\n\nThis chapter defines listed property and explains the special rules and depreciation deduction limits that apply, including the special inclusion amount rule for leased property. It also discusses the recordkeeping rules for listed property and explains how to report information about the property on your tax return.\n\nUseful Items\nYou may want to see:\n\n\nPublication\n\n\n463  Travel, Gift, and Car Expenses\n\n\n587  Business Use of Your Home \n\n\n\n\nForm (and Instructions)\n\n\n2106  Employee Business Expenses \n\n\n4562  Depreciation and Amortization \n\n\n4797  Sales of Business Property \n\n\n\nSee How To Get Tax Help at the end of this publication for information about getting publications and forms.\n\n\nWhat Is Listed Property?\n\nListed property is any of the following.\n\n\n\nPassenger automobiles (as defined later).\n\n\nBusiness aircraft (discussed later).\n\n\nAny other property used for transportation, unless it is an excepted vehicle.\n\n\nProperty generally used for entertainment, recreation, or amusement (including photographic, phonographic, communication, and video recording equipment).\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements to listed property.\n\nAn improvement made to listed property that must be capitalized is treated as a new item of depreciable property. The recovery period and method of depreciation that apply to the listed property as a whole also apply to the improvement. For example, if you must depreciate the listed property using the straight line method, you must also depreciate the improvement using the straight line method.""]"
